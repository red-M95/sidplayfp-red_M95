this is my fork of sidplayfp, it adds a master volume meter in binary that might partially help visualizing digi samples, a filter viewer, and a channel filter viewer, to see which channels are being filtered, and also a filter resonance meter.
i plan on making those visible for whoever sets the verbosity level to > 2, rather than leaving it for the original > 1 level.
