this is my fork of sidplayfp that provides some extra features, like a detailed filter view. i plan on adding more features over time, but nothing really ambitious for now.

changes made so far:
-master volume meter:
 -shows the master volume, in binary. it can also be used to see digi samples being played.

-filter viewers:
 -low pass (lp), band pass (bp), high pass (hp), and voice 3 off (3o). when switched on, their names get capitalized.
 -filtered channels: shows which channels are being filtered.
 -filter resonance: shows the filter resonance, in binary. ranges from no resonance, %0000, to max. resonance, %1111.
 -filter cutoff: shows the filter cutoff frequency, in binary as well. approximately ranges from 30 hz - 10 khz, using an 11-bit counter.

-showing some essential keybinds during playback:
 -during playback, the original sidplayfp just displays "Playing, press ESC to stop...(elapsed time)". so, i decided to make it show which keys are used for going to the previous tune, pause, going to next tune, and stop (obviously). this makes it a bit easier to figure out how to use it.

-changes on the keybinds:
 -nothing really interesting, now you can use either the esc or the 'q' key to stop playing. i decided to add the 'q' key 'cos lazy hands like mine wouldn't have to move to such a distant place. yeah, i know what you're thinking.

-current plans:
 -none. i might suddenly come up with one without even mentioning, though.
